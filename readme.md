# Calculator - Frontend Masters Study Project

A modern calculator built as part of the [Complete Intro to Web Development v3](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/) course by Brian Holt on Frontend Masters.

## Project Overview

This project started as a basic calculator exercise from the Frontend Masters course, but I extended it with additional features to continue learning and practicing web development concepts.

## Features

### Core Calculator Functions

- Basic arithmetic operations (+, −, ×, ÷)
- Decimal number support
- Backspace and clear functionality
- Percentage calculations
- Chain operations (e.g., 2 + 3 × 4)
- Division by zero protection

### Extended Features (Added for Learning)

- **Modern UI Design**: Glassmorphism effects with gradient backgrounds
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **History Panel**: Session-based calculation history with slide-out animation
- **Keyboard Support**: Full keyboard navigation and input
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions and hover effects
- **Clean Architecture**: Well-commented code for learning purposes

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key             | Action                |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| `0-9`           | Number input          |
| `.`             | Decimal point         |
| `+`             | Addition              |
| `-`             | Subtraction           |
| `*`             | Multiplication        |
| `/`             | Division              |
| `Enter` or `=`  | Calculate result      |
| `Escape` or `c` | Clear calculator      |
| `Backspace`     | Delete last digit     |
| `%`             | Convert to percentage |
| `h`             | Toggle history panel  |

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic structure
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with custom properties, grid, flexbox
- **CSS Animations**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks - pure DOM manipulation

## What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced and learned:

- **Event Delegation**: Using a single event listener for all buttons
- **State Management**: Managing calculator state with multiple variables
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Using CSS variables for consistent theming
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with media queries
- **Animation Timing**: Coordinating CSS transitions with JavaScript
- **Code Organization**: Writing clean, commented code for maintainability
- **Error Handling**: Protecting against edge cases (division by zero, multiple decimals)
